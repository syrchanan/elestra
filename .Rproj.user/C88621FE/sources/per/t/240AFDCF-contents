# Timeline

Though the current day is in 25,277 HEA, the history of Elestra can be separated into many ages, which will guide us through the past and into the present. As it once was, so shall it be again, for the gods weave these stories as they will and want.  

The following has been largely compiled by Jarik Krestel, a scholar of his age. I have made some edits and additions to his work.  

## Age of the Seekers {-}  

In this time, the first beings sought to find their way.  

### Pre-World {-}  

The Maker made the other lesser gods.  

### 277 HEA {-}  

The world was formed by the Maker and his helpers.  

The First sentient race awoke, it is lost to us as to what they called themselves, though the High Elves called them *Thene'we*, meaning "star seekers" in elvish. They were a Reptilian like race with green scaled skin, four arms, thin, lithe, tall bodies, and long tails.  

### 4,227 HEA {-}  

The First Elves Awoke in their forest at night.  

As they did, they were awed by the beauty of the Stars and the forest they saw, they named the forest *Inar'uthwe* (the forest of starlight). The Word *Inar'uthwe* soon also became used as the Elvish name for the High elves. They soon founded their capital city of *Elino'thunin*, the city of many waterfalls.  

Noxel the god of Nature, seeing the Elves' love of all things green and beautiful in the world which he had helped the Maker create, came to the their young race and offered them a great gift, immortality from age and protection from all sickness. The Elves gladly accepted and helped steward the many forests and fields of the world in return for their handsome gift.  

### 6,227 HEA {-}  

The *Thene'we* kept mostly to themselves during all this time.  

However, they did interact with the Elves on a small trading basis, though never taught them their language nor customs, seeing them as a lesser creation. Around this time they started suffering from a great plague, and they started a massive civil war that spanned the whole of the world. In what many scholars think - they, in an attempt to save their race and give themselves the powers equal to that of the gods, performed some kind of profane magic that not only made all their race vanish in a blink of an eye, but tore and ripped apart the very foundations of the world. Many think the “scar” is the epicenter of this cataclysmic event and where their capital city was.  

As no *Thene'we* have been seen since they are considered extinct, many of their ruins still are dotted around the world.  

## Age of Reverence {-}  

In the turning of this age, the peoples revered the First.  

### 8,227 {-}  

The first *Natu* awoke in the sea.  

They made homes out of the many old *Thene'we* cities, whom they call the Ancients, that were now underwater. *Natu* are an aquatic race that can breathe both air and water. It is said they can live to be about 250 years old, though members of the race that never set foot on land tend to live up to 350. There is no proof that air or being on land hurts them, it just simply may be more dangerous for them as they are out of their element that they were not born into.  

The *Natu* have many legends of the ancients, though they never met them. It is considered culturally "odd" for *Natu* to live away from the water for long periods of time, and they are very rarely seen outside of the western continent. They are a martial and ritualistic culture, in that every action and word has deep meaning (or at least should). I warn any who may cross paths with the *Natu* to consider their words and actions carefully, for meaning may be found where none is.  

Yton, lord of the seas, is considered the protector of the *Natu*. As such, they worship him along with the Maker.  

Names have very deep meaning to them as they consider your birth name to designate your future. Who you will become, in a very literal sense, can be attributed to your name. Both  your profession and your emotional state of being can even be derived from your name. This, of course, does not make the child be that type of person, it just causes everyone to treat them as though they will and should be that. Though it is appropriate to treat them as such in *Natu* culture, I caution the reader to not underestimate a *Natuan*, for once in a great while will one use their name as a disguise to hide their true intentions.  

Name Examples:  

1.    Great Warrior
1.    Serene of Heart 
1.    Brave Explorer 
1.    Valiant 
1.    Charitable 
1.    Protector of the downcast 
1.    Renowned Chef

How these names are written in their language: 

1.    *Kinis Anolmath* 
1.    *Nemes Udolna* 
1.    *Vohro Udarsal* 
1.    *Zeg Namolna* 
1.    *Runus Erul* 
1.    *Narna Pehnom* 
1.    *Raneminon Vurr*  

### 10,227 HEA {-}  

The First Dwarfs (the *Drudain Kruz*, Dwarvish for "People of Stone") awoke in the deep darkness of the mountain caves.  

They were skilled artisans, and for many decades they thought that there was only dark caves and tunnels to the whole of the world. As they delved ever deeper into the dark earth, they finally emerged to the surface one day. They built great underground cities and marvels, becoming unsurpassed in their craftsmanship and forging. For this reason, many dwarfs worship Pavdos god of fire along with the Maker.  

They first encountered the Elves, and were surprised by their races' differences. Though there was mostly peace between them and the Elves, only minor dispute wars were fought.  

However, a great war was fought with the Goblins, which were led by horrible creatures called *Unok*. These were encountered for the first time ever in the deepest dark. This war was brutal, with the dwarves losing half of their massive underground empire, which lasted for hundreds of years before the tide was stopped. Many “reclamation wars” have since been fought.  

### 13,227 HEA {-}  

A Group of Elves set off to the mystical forest of *Thalanil*, which literally translates to "Deep Wood".  

Wood Elves, as they became known as, are rarely seen outside of their forest, which is shrouded in mystery. Almost all who enter are never seen again, or oddly find themselves turned outward away from the forest when they were trying to enter.  

Only the oldest High elves can even remember the names of their kin that live there. However, only a very few know why. Wood elves are immortal, just as the high elves are. 

Nowadays, many small human towns and villages are dotted around the forest. Only the most brave - or those that worship Noxel, the god of nature - dare live near the forest, since it is considered cursed by some, and blessed by others.   
One human scholar by the name of Riknard Vilcon spent his whole life with the High elves trying to ascertain why the Wood Elves left their High bretheren, and what they are presently doing. This was not a easy thing for him to research, as the Elves refused to answer him. Though after decades of prying into the matter, he learned only one thing from a very old scroll that was more myth and legend then reliable source:  

> “There was not dancing nor singing as they left with grim determination, they set off to safe guard the gate till the undoing of the world.”.

## Age of Allegiances {-} 

### 14,227 HEA {-}  

The First Humans awoke.  

They promptly formed tribes and small kingdoms in open fields, which is now the central continent. Even faster, they made war on each other, traded with the other races, and became ever more prosperous. Humans seem not to do anything slowly, and rising to power was no exception.

### 15,227 HEA {-}  

The High Elves and Dwarfs ruled most of the main continent, while humans were in small kingdoms and tribes.  

Together, they all formed an alliance to fight a massive giant and ogre invasion from beyond the north seas. Many maps of this time say there was habitable land in the far north, which is now quite frozen over.  

After winning this hard fought war, the Elven prince *Eli'Tion*, his name meaning “Bright sun”, married the human queen of the largest human kingdom. Her name was Vereen and they started the Dawn bloodline - and also founded the Kingdom of Solen. The elven blood has blessed the Dawn line with extended long life, and all Dawn children to this day have dark hair like that of *Eli'tion*.  

*Eli'tion* was mercifully put to sleep, at his request, with his wife Vereen when she passed, since he could not bear her passing. Many humans have chosen to forget this Elven lineage nowadays, and even depict him as a normal human in most art and paintings. He is often even renamed *Etion*, a more humanized spelling of his name.

### 17,227 HEA {-}  

Not much is known of this time in the Age of Allegiances.  

However, it has been noted that the Human Kindom of Narsha was formed in the desert, when all the tribes were brought under one banner.  

In hindsight, this event has been deemed formative enough on the rest of history to be the major source of the name of the age.   

## The Age of Magic {-}  

### 17,727 HEA {-}  

The elf mage Nashia formed what is now known as the spider cult.  

They devoted themselves to dark magic and Vocella, the goddess of secrets. Nashia, her kin, and followers were cast out from the forest as they were threatening to destroy it from their magics.  

Noxel, seeing this group and their wickedness, broke their connection to nature and immortality. Their skin went dark and their eyes turned red, then they were banished from all High elven society forever.  

After this, the cult started to take people of all races - to kill them in magic rituals as a way to extend their own lives. Cult members lived about 750 years normally - but “can”, through their horrible magics, live 2,000 years. Nashia is the exception, as she still rules them today and is the oldest living Dark Elf.  

The Dark Elves have even formed their own kingdom, under the reign of Nashia.

### 18,227 HEA {-}  

The Human Kingdom of Anor was formed.  

Located on the northern icy continent, the humans endured many significant events - including protecting and siding with dragons. These pacts with the dragons were aimed at aiding inpurging the island of all remaining Giants. Namely, the Stormwind Family made an alliance with the Red Dragon Flight - and even has dragon blood flowing in the royal family’s veins.  

### 19,727 HEA {-}  

The Dark Elves started waging war on all surrounding kingdoms.  

The Dark Elves are also known as *Dway'thaun*, meaning Fallen Ones - a name that they have embraced. Their language is called fallen speech, since they refuse to speak High Elvish any more beyond the name that was given to them.  

Since their power and numbers had grown strong since their exile, eventually the High Elves and Humans had to force the Dark Elves back into their dark stronghold in the southwest mountains. It was very costly, with many casualties on both sides, though after a time, the High Elves and Humans were victorious.  

The Dark Elves have remained in their stronghold ever since; however, they do send out many raiders on the seas to take captives and slaves.

### 20,227 HEA {-}  

Humans founded the five cities.

Not many details are known of this time. Perhaps stories have faded in favor of the more exciting legends of the past. Who knows, perhaps the turning of the age shall reveal more.  

### 21,227 HEA {-}  

The great dragon hunts were started in the central continent.  

All dragons that remain really only live on Anor, and even then perhaps are just rumors. It is said in stories that they may be called back to the main continent via the blowing of a horn. However, there can be little validity offered to this tale, since it can only be found in one scholar's report.  

I plan on conducting research on this area soon, though if no addendum is added to this field guide - well, you can assume an unwanted fate befell me.  

### 22,727 HEA {-}  

The cat-like Cathar began raiding the Narsha and Solen coasts.  

This lasted until the Cathar were soundly beaten back, once the Narsha and Solen organized their responses to the attacks. Similar to the previous few thousand years, scholars who investigated this matter were typically not heard from again.  

## Age of the Breaking of the World {-}  

### 23,727 HEA {-}  
The Solen launched an invasion of Narsha.  

The endeavor was a succes, and for 400 years they ruled the desert. The Narshin people have since rebelled and took back their land. Even though there were attempts made by the Solen to reclaim it, all have failed thus far.  

### 24,227 HEA {-}   

The Humans launched a campaign of purification against the world.  

King Helon the Mighty - or the Usurper, as some call him - was an outsider from Anor and the second husband of the human dawn queen Marcel. She had two sons from her previous marriage to a "true" member of the Dawn lineage. However, once Helon had gained his new title and the support of the generals of Solen, he set out on a bloody crusade to purge all that was not human.  

This decision broke the long standing alliances the humans had with the Elves and Dwarfs. For 40 years, he waged a terrible war Called “The War of Judgment” by many humans, claiming all non-humans were to blame for all the troubles of the world.  

The Wars were called other names, including *Ionin’celvenin* (Elvish for "The War of Great Sorrow") and *Gway toinak* (Dwarvish for "The War of Betrayal").   

All non human races formed an alliance, with Dwarfs and Elves doing most of the fighting.   

It ended at the Battle of Three Rivers, near RiverWatch. Helon was in the rear of his army, and the human army vastly outnumbered the allied forces of Elves and Dwarves. A hand picked group of Elite Dwarves and Elves, seeing only one option, set out in the midst of the battle to fight their way to Helon himself. The elite force fought bravely as they punched a hole through the enemy lines and were surrounded, yet they pressed on.   

Nearly all had been slain, yet the dwarves managed to get a skilled Elven archer just within range of Helon. The feared Human King was slain when an Elven arrow struck him in the head.  

Upon seeing this, the battle ended, with the humans throwing down their arms. Later, his step-sons, who were under house arrest at the time, then made peace with the forces allied against them. Somehow, they managed to keep much of the lands Helon had taken. Though the Wars officially ended, the great Elven thorn wall (which was grown during these wars) remains, and the Dwarven mountains are still heavily fortified.  

Even though there has been peace ever since, it has been uneasy, as many humans still can be racist toward other races.  

### 25,022 HEA {-}  

The invasion of Anor was launched by the Solen.  

This conflict raged for 20 years as the Solen attempt to take the isles. This time, they failed, yet the desire for these lands has never faded.  

### 25,277 HEA {-}  

Solen is again at war with Anor.  

Yet again, Solen forces are trying to take the isles. Thus far, it has been going for 5 years, with no clear victor as of yet.
